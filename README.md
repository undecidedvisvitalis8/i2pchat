## Downloads (pre-built binaries)

* Latest Windows (Win32/64) build from: <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wipedlifepotato/i2pchat/build/artifacts">https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wipedlifepotato/i2pchat/build/artifacts</a>
* 0.2.37 Linux binary (stripped) with custom profile template and event audio samples (Qt 5.14 or later required): <a href="https://vituperative.github.io/i2pchat/I2PChat0.2.37-Linux.zip">I2PChat0.2.37-Linux.zip</a>

## Running

On Linux, `make` creates `I2PChat` executable in the current folder. Run it with `./I2PChat`.

* You will need to enable the SAM application bridge in your router: for Java I2P via <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclients">Client Configuration</a> or for i2pd via i2pd.conf's [SAM] section.
* As of version 0.2.31, the DSA_SHA1 Signature type is no longer available. The recommended (and default) Signature Type is now: EdDSA_SHA512_Ed25519
* Select 'Online' from the dropdown menu on the main window. When you first go online, your unique address (Destination) will be created when connecting to SAM
* Your settings and contacts will be stored in `~/.i2pchat/` on Linux-based systems, or `%APPDATA%\Roaming\I2PChat\` on Windows
